# PiP Widget Auto-Open Feature

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Auto-Open on Website Visit**
The PiP widget now automatically opens when users visit the website!

**How it works:**
- `pip-context.tsx` has `isOpen` state set to `true` by default
- Widget appears immediately when page loads
- Shows in expanded view (not minimized)
- Positioned at bottom-right corner

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// lib/pip-context.tsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true) // Auto-open on load
```

### 2. **App Logo Beside Status**
Added the club's logo image next to LIVE/UPCOMING/COMPLETED status indicators.

**Features:**
- 16×16px logo image from `/public/logo.png`
- Shows for all status types (LIVE, UPCOMING, COMPLETED)
- Properly sized and aligned with status text
- Rounded corners with smooth rendering

**Visual Layout:**
```
[TC Icon] Tennis Club
          [🏆 Logo] [●] LIVE     ← Logo appears here
```

### 3. **Improved Widget Size**
Increased widget size for better visibility and logo display:
- **Width:** 280px (was 160px)
- **Minimized:** 10×10px circle with tennis emoji 🎾
- **Better spacing** for logo and text
