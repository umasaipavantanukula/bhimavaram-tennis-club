## 🔧 Known Issues (Pre-existing)

These TypeScript errors were present before changes and don't affect functionality:

1. **matches-manager.tsx**: Type error with `status` field
2. **events-manager.tsx**: Type error with `category` field
3. **gallery-manager.tsx**: Type error with `category` field
4. **news-manager.tsx**: Type error with `category` field
5. **globals.css**: CSS linting warnings (not actual errors)

These are type definition issues that should be fixed separately but don't impact the responsive design improvements.
